A MATLAB-based tool for analyzing the aerodynamic performance of an aircraft. The program calculates lift, drag, power requirements, and lift-to-drag ratio based on user-defined inputs such as altitude, wing area, lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and velocity range. It visualizes the results through dynamic plots and provides key metrics for evaluating aircraft efficiency. T
